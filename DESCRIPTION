Description: A Bayesian procedure for estimating the probability of differential
    item functioning (DIF) or measurement invariance across latent unknown groups.
    Unlike most DIF procedures that compare item parameters across known groups,
    the bDif procedure provided uses mixture modeling and latent group assignment
    to simultaneously detect DIF probabilities for each item, non-DIF and DIF
    item parameters,latent abilities, and latent group membership probabilities.
    Moreover, one can predict latent group membership from covariates to better
    understand the makeup of the latent groups for which some items seem to operate
    differentially.
