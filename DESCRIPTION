Description: A Bayesian procedure for estimating the probability of differential item functioning
		(DIF) or measurement invariance across latent unknown groups. Unlike most DIF procedures that
		compare item parameters across known groups, the bDif procedure provided uses mixture modeling
		and latent group assignment to simultaneously detect DIF probabilities for each item,
		non-DIF and DIF item parameters,latent abilities, and latent group membership probabilities.
		Moreover, one can predict	latent group membership from covariates to better understand
		the makeup of the latent groups for which some items seem to operate differentially.
